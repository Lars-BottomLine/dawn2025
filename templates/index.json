CIMSPA are one of the most reputable awarding bodies in UK’s fitness sector. You can check out more about them on the CIMSPA website (please see our blog post here).<br/><br/>Another thing you should look for is what awarding body is attributed to each personal training course.<br/><br/>The largest and most recognisable of the professional bodies is Active IQ. Making sure that you pick an Active IQ course, is going to benefit you greatly as you progress from entry level to becoming a more specialist fitness instructor.<br/><br/>The next step is to get an entry level qualification by taking the Level 2 Certificate in Gym Instructing, which will allow you to qualify as a gym-based instructor. While, you might not be able to take part in teaching all the gym programmes, across all leisure centres, this course is the minimum entry requirement into the industry. Following this, you can do a Level 3 Diploma in Personal Training, which will open more doors for you and you can then start working as an independent Level 3 Personal Trainer.<br/><br/>You can do all of these steps with Study Active. We are one the most reputable fitness training providers in the UK. With us, you can study any of several gym instructor or personal training courses individually or opt to do these in larger combined course packages, to fast track your PT career. Check out the price guide shown in the personal trainer course package comparison section above to get an idea of the various payment options and what courses are available for you.<br/><br/>There is also the option to opt for a higher-level package which includes Level 4 Advanced Personal Training and/or RSPH Level 4 Nutrition. While they are not essential to begin working as a PT, Level 4 qualifications are incredibly useful for your professional development and will help you build your confidence and passion for fitness. Have a browse, if you need more help, get in contact with us and we can help you figure out how to start your new career.</p>"

You can continue your professional development by taking on more qualifications like these such as 'Supporting clients with long-term conditions' or 'Pre & post natal exercise' which will help you support and work more effectively with clientele such as older adults or those suffering from health conditions.</p>"
